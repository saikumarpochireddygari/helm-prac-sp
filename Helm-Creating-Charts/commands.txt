# Creating First Chart
## by default helm uses nginx as a default chart template and using it, it gives us first chart structure for us. We can also use other default chart templates for this. 

cli: helm create _CHART_NAME_
~ this creates 
_CHART_NAME_ Folder:
    ~ Chart.yaml : This is where meta data about chart exsist
    ~ charts Folder : If our _CHART_NAME_ depends on other chart to get its job done, then thoose charts are pulled and stored inside of this folder
    ~ templates : Here actual manifests etc will be there to deploy into k8
    ~ values.yaml : these are the values file which contains default values that should go into templates folder. 

# To install the above created Chart    
cli: helm install myapp _CHART_NAME_ -f values.yml
